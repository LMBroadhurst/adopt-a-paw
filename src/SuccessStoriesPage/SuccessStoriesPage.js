                        <p>Fourteen-year-old Staffy, Gizmo, came to the Shelter when his owner moved and was unable to take him to their new home. Despite his age, he is full of beans and quickly made friends with everyone he met. It often takes longer to find older dogs the right match but, happily for Gizmo, he stole the hearts of new owner Chelsea and went home in May, three months after arriving.</p>

                      <p>Beautiful Bulldog, Buzz, was brought to the Shelter as a stray in December 2021. This lovely chap was only seven-months-old at the time and sadly his owner could not be traced. It is no surprise that it didnâ€™t take long for someone to adopt him and he went to his new family just one month later.</p>
