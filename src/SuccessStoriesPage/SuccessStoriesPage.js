                        <p>Fourteen-year-old Staffy, Gizmo, came to the Shelter when his owner moved and was unable to take him to their new home. Despite his age, he is full of beans and quickly made friends with everyone he met. It often takes longer to find older dogs the right match but, happily for Gizmo, he stole the hearts of new owner Chelsea and went home in May, three months after arriving.</p>

                        <p>Three-year-old Ernie came to the Shelter as a stray when people noticed he had been roaming around for over a month and was showing signs of neglect. Ernie was very friendly with our staff and soon caught the eye of his new owner, Jenny.</p>

                      <p>Beautiful Bulldog, Buzz, was brought to the Shelter as a stray in December 2021. This lovely chap was only seven-months-old at the time and sadly his owner could not be traced. It is no surprise that it didnâ€™t take long for someone to adopt him and he went to his new family just one month later.</p>
